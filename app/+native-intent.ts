/**
 * Native Intent Handler for Expo Router
 * 
 * This file intercepts deep links and share intents BEFORE they reach the router,
 * preventing malformed routes from hitting the not-found page.
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. When a share intent is triggered, expo-share-intent generates a deep link
 *    like: /dataUrl=cliprackShareKey
 * 2. This handler catches that deep link and redirects to a valid route
 * 3. The user never sees the malformed URL or hits the not-found page
 * 
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
 * - Share intents generate internal URLs that aren't valid app routes
 * - Without this handler, users would see "This screen does not exist"
 * - This ensures smooth navigation from share intents to the clips tab
 * 
 * CONFIGURATION:
 * - This is a special Expo Router feature that automatically gets detected
 * - No additional configuration needed - just place this file in the app/ directory
 * - Expo Router automatically calls redirectSystemPath for all incoming deep links
 * 
 * DOCUMENTATION:
 * - See: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/router/#nativeintent
 * 
 * @param path - The incoming deep link path (e.g., /dataUrl=cliprackShareKey)
 * @param initial - The initial route when the app was launched
 * @returns A valid route path that the app can navigate to
